# BMP280 Driver Component

## Get Started

This driver, along with many other components from this repository, can be used as a package from [Espressif's IDF Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com). To include this driver in your project, run the following idf.py from the project's root directory:

```
    idf.py add-dependency "maucke/bmp280^1.0.0"
```

Another option is to manually create a `idf_component.yml` file. You can find more about using .yml files for components from [Espressif's documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager.html).

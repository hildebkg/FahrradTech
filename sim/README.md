# Simulation Files

Simulation files for this project were created using National Instruments Multisim version 14.3.

* [Turn signal controls](light_control.ms14)

*Note: KiCad does support SPICE simulation, but I have never used it, and I have heard that the learning curve is steep. I am already used to using Multisim through my university, so I chose to use that for now. There is a free online version which can be accessed [here](https://www.multisim.com/), but they do not currently support importing .MS14 files, so I have added screenshots to this folder for recreation purposes.*
